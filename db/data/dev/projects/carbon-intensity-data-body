<h>Intro</h>

<p>
  I built this webpage while learning <l>React</l>. The page will request some
  information from an external api, then pass the data to a third-party
  <l>React</l> component to render it as a graph.
</p>

<p>
  The date to show information for is saved as a state variable. When the user
  interacts with the form to change the date, a rerender of the graph is
  triggered with new data requested from the api.
</p>

<h>The API</h>

<p>
  In this case, the information is
  <b
    >carbon intensity levels in Great Britain as a result of electricity
    generation</b
  >. This information comes from
  <a href="https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/">National Grid</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The fetched data parsed into a <l>JavaScript</l> object that can be
  interpreted by the graph component.
</p>

<h>The React Library</h>

<p>
  I used a chart library called
  <a href="https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/">react-chartjs-2</a>, which provides
  <l>React</l> components that render charts for tabulated passed as a argument.
</p>

<!--code
  import { Bar } from 'react-chartjs-2';

  ...

  // chartData comes from the api request

  const data = {
    labels: chartData.map(el => el.time),
    datasets: [
      {
        label: 'Actual',
        data: chartData.map(el => el.actual),
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)',
      },
      {
        label: 'Forecast',
        data: chartData.map(el => el.forecast),
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(53, 162, 235, 0.5)',
      },
    ],
  };

  const options = {
    responsive: true,
    plugins: {
      legend: {
        position: 'top',
      }
    },
  };

  ...

  <Bar data={data} options={options} />

<h>Outro</h>

<p>
  This was an interesting project to learn the basics of <l>React</l>. I also
  had the chance to practice and learn more about <b>api requests</b> and
  <b>responsive design</b> using <l>CSS</l>.
